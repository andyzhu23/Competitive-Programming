# Welcome!
Hello, my name is Andy Zhu, I am a high schooler interested in Competitive Programming. This repo is just for me to review my own solutions

[andy_zhu23](https://dmoj.ca/user) on DMOJ(currently master, I would say decent)

[Andy.zhu23](https://codeforces.com/profile/Andy.zhu23) on codeforces(currently specialist, I would say I am just really trash)
