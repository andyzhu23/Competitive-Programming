### Hello, This is my Competitive-Programming Solution page, I mainly created it for myself to review all the solutions that I coded, if you enjoy my noobie code then good for you

For those java solutions, I named the main class Main for convenience when submitting the code file

If you see any issues, please feel free to send pull requests or send me an email to let me know.
